            <h2>Internet ID Laws?</h2>
            <article>
            <p>Well kids, the time has finally come. In the great crusade for creating safe spaces for the children online, Britbong land is the latest of nations that has finally done it! They have waved the magical wand for protecting the kids from the horrors found on many sites on the internet! Hurray! The children are saved and will be safe forever! That‚Äôs a wrap folks, all children big and small will live happily ever after.</p>

            <p>Now coming back into the real world, the introduction of defacto online ID laws for certain websites seems to come from a place of pure and good intentions. I mean, no one really wants the kiddies to have access to some of the most degenerate corners of the internet 24 hours a day. But a government backed organisation like OFCOM (who, for those who are not under the thumb of the British government are basically the entity that enforces online and tv legislation), is being given the powers to force not only websites to demand users from certain areas provide ID to prove their age, but force users from certain geographic locations to hand over their ID is just not the way, in my opinion, to protect the kids. And that‚Äôs if these kinds of measures were going to work 99% of the time straight out of the box, which we know is far from the case.</p>

            <p>Theres a myriad of parts to this diabolical mess and im going to get into them but dont be fooled, just because you yourself may not have the holy honour of being a subject of these *beautiful* British isles, doesn't mean that this wont affect you in the future. Even as you are watching this video, various politicians in countries like the US and New Zealand are drafting or pushing for legislation that introduces restrictions on the access to sites that contain certain types of content. You will be next.</p>

            <p>Countries like France have already implemented checks. But, of course, the entire concept of requiring the user to supply personal identifiable information to access the naughty online A: doesn‚Äôt address the actual issues that are introduced when children access the internet and B: won‚Äôt and doesn't work anyway even when implemented.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Did big government forget about VPNs?</h3>
            <p>The number one way people avoid the issue of supplying their personal information to access age restricted websites is of course through the use of a VPN. Tunnel Bear, Nord VPN, Express VPN, every single government backed YouTuber shilled vpn company can be used for exactly this, with Proton VPN being a free one and Mullvad being the only legit VPN you should consider using, there certainly is no shortage of VPN companies to use. And of course this method only works because there are still countries that do not require internet users accessing certain sites to supply their ID to prove their age.</p>

            <p>The Tor network can also be utilised to accomplish the same thing, though this would likely result in slower download speeds so, no ultra 8k VR anime girl experiences there I‚Äôm afraid.</p>

            <p>Kids could also just use their parents ID, bank cards or digital ID apps to be able to gain access to these age restricted sites. You heard that right, they have decided that one of the forms of age verification that they are willing to accept is a bank card. I am still bewildered as to how they think this is going to be effective in the slightest.</p>

            <p>The mad methods of age verification doesnt stop there though, they‚Äôre also willing to accept EMAIL as a method! I‚Äôm kind of torn as to how I feel about it, because on one hand, its not going to work at all and it all seems too invasive for no reason, and on the other hand, in what world should it be up to the government to see which websites im visiting?</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Data leaks and privacy violations</h3>
            <p>Now of course, one of the main problems that I feel will come as a result of these measures is the possibility of a data leak. First of all, the various age verification companies and organisations that could be used publicly state that the most secure database is quote ‚Äúno database at all‚Äù which sounds promising, but, being companies, we have no idea if they are storing certain bits of uniquely identifying information on those who submit their personal data or not. What about the websites they are contracted to operate for?</p>

            <p>The websites that have been instructed to implement age verification measures will of course see a huge downturn in their traffic, as introducing barriers to entry such as ID laws has been proven to do. And where does this loss of traffic go? Because it certainly wont all disappear. Far from it.</p>

            <p>What is likely to happen as a result from these digital ID laws is what the government is claiming they want to stop from increasing, which is children being exposed to online material they shouldn‚Äôt be able to see. But even worse, stay with me here.</p>
            <p>The most popular and visited websites of the variety that is directly in the cross hairs of this legislation have been subject to the most public scrutiny. Now once you effectively stop consumers from accessing those sites without a VPN or handing over the ID, if they have any, you force them to look elsewhere. To look at those sites in which they would not have found if you didnt implement these ID laws. And these websites, being smaller in size, could have an increased likelihood of having even more sketchy and degenerate material.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>It's probably not going to end well</h3>
            <p>I think this is one of those catch 22 scenarios, where no matter which way the government goes with it, they will be scrutinised for not doing enough. Personally, and quite controversially, im quite the anarchist when it comes to freedom online, not to say im in favour of 0 legislation, but as little as possible. Quite the 180 from my views about the real world but lets not get too political now.</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs not that I think mandated digital ID from the government is going to be the end of the world, it‚Äôs just that i think its more of a nothing burger done for show. It shouldn‚Äôt be for the government to decide or have a say in family affairs at this level. This is down to the parents, and how they parent their children. Allowing their kids to have unrestricted access to the internet is a bad idea. All it takes is a couple parental controls on their Ipod touch they got for their 12th birthday and that would likely prevent them from accessing material they shouldn't access.</p>
