            <h2>About Thunking Wales and Me</h2>
            <p>I've always found writing about topics and sharing my thoughts about Linux, politics and lots of other stuff that I find interesting a fun hobby to entertain myself with, (I spend far too much time on watching YouTube videos, so when I do start writing scripts for videos or articles to post somewhere, it's good!).</p>
            <p>I'm not Welsh, but I have lived in Wales for a period of time and really do enjoy living there. And seen as I enjoy it, I thought I'd mix and match my passion for technology, my current occupation of being a Computer Science student and my love for Wales into this website.</p>
            <p>You might see this website, the simplistic, amateurish design of it and then read that I'm currently a Computer Science student and get slightly perplexed. Well, don't be! The more I have learnt about technology and web development, the more I have come to appreciate the beauty in simplicity and functionality. The web is far too bloated as it is, with JavaScript littering every website you go to. What's the need for it? Return to a more traditional internet I say, but I'll leave it there before I start writing up a blog post about it.</p>
